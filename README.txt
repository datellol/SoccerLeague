To execute tests:

	src/ contains source code files
	
	bin/ contains executables java files

	running at folder SoccerLeague with junit library in the same directory:
	
		java -cp "./*;bin" soccerLeagueTest/SoccerLeagueTest

	I setup some valid and invalid test cases, only alphabetical order is not being considered, only points from highest to lowest values
